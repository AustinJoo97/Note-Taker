## Description, Setup, and Installation

This application is a very quick and intuitive note-taker program that allows a user to create, delete, and save notes in a persistent form until they are later deleted manually. Utilizing Express.JS, functionality was added via api routes that read and altered JSON information to ultimately return some form of information to the user. With each note created, a unique ID was also tacked on when attaching it to the list of notes on the left side.

In order to setup this application, simply install the dependencies listed in the package.json file by inputing "npm install" at the correct file path. Afterwards, running node index.js from the Develop/db directory will spin up the express server and handle calls coming in at the assigned port (8080 is otherwise the default).
